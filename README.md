# pandas-challenge

Py City Schools project is analyzing the standardized math and reading test scores of students of 15 schools in the city.  Two datasets in csv format were used in this python-pandas project (school_complete.csv, student_complete.csv). There are 7 district schools and 8 charter schools. The number of students ranges from 427 (Holden High School) to 4976 (Bailey High School). The math and reading scores were studied at district level, and school level. The averages of the scores were analyzed based on the grade level, budget spent for each student, school size and school type. Highest and lowest performing schools are also identified as a part of this project.

In addition to the class activities and the information from office hours with our instructor and TAs, I used the following sources for extra help with this assignment
